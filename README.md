## Reflections
- This was super fun, I enjoyed the challenge overall. I will say that I went too fast at the beginning and should have read the user stories a little more closely. Instead of paying enough attention to each one I skimmed forward thinking about how to solve the problem. This resulted in my having to backtrack and put info that should have been on the students index page in a place it didnt' belong. Not a huge deal but for the sake of efficiency I would do well to slow down during timed challenges. 
- I feel pretty good about my methods and work overall, although I couldn't complete the tests for the extension. 
	- It makes sense to use an each_with_index and in the test check if each expected item is included in the section with that index, I just couldn't work out how to call that information in the spec. 
- I definitely want to look into/practice structuring my specs using within blocks. I would also love to see how I could have used the each_with_index. Because although the orderly gem is useful i'd rather not rely on gems just in case. I've struggled with finding good literature for comparison online. 
- Thank you for your time and feedback! I appreciate it very much.
